String articleContent = '''The quest to understand purpose has being one of the mostly carried out activities by every person who have walked this earth. It has baffled mankind since the inception of time.  After all, none of us played a role in our own existence. However this paper seeks to remind us “Believers in Christ”, that understanding purpose does not only determine our future on earth but most importantly extends beyond this life of grey matter. According to the word of God (Colossians 1:16, Ephesians 2: 10), e very “thing” that exists was created by God, through God, and for Jesus Christ.  Therefore, our purpose exists in the mind and will of God. Just as we all know, once the purpose of a thing is not known, it is subject to abuse/misuse. Rick Warren said  “without clear purpose, you have no foundation on which to base decisions,  allocate your time and use your resources: without purpose you may tend to make choices based on circumstances, pressure and your mood at that moment”. That is to say, purpose is greater than our family, career, ambitions and dreams. If we must understand purpose, we must begin with God by searching his mind and will through prayer and consistent Bible studying.''';
